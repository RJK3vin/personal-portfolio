                <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    I'm Kevin Ritthaworn — a full-stack software engineer who helps
                    startups and small businesses bring their ideas to life. I design and
                    build clean, scalable, and functional digital tools that solve real
                    problems.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    From landing pages and client portals to custom MVPs and business
                    dashboards, I work across the stack to deliver fast, responsive
                    solutions. While I often build with tools like React, TypeScript, and
                    Node.js, I adapt quickly to whatever technologies a project calls for.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    My approach is simple: understand the business goal, build efficiently,
                    communicate clearly, and make sure the end product actually delivers
                    value. Whether you're launching a new product or upgrading an existing
                    system, I bring a practical, reliable mindset to every collaboration.
